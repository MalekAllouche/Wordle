# Wordle 
In this assignment, I have implemented a clone for Wordle in Java using
only the Swing Library built-in.

## How to play
It's quite simple. You have 6 guesses to figure out a 5 lettered word. 
For each guess, the game tells you if you have a letter in the correct 
spot, incorrect spot, or if the letter is not a part of the word at all.

## My implementation
The word to guess, in my implementation, comes from a list of words in the file 
called "targetWords.txt" and the user can input all types of words into the
game from the "gameDictionary.txt" file. 

For testing purposes, I have also outputted the word to the user in my
implementation.
